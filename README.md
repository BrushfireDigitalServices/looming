Looming is a WYSIWYG pattern design program geared toward grid-based crafts such as loom knitting and beading.

Vision
------

Many artists use graph paper, spreadsheets programs like Excel, and high-resolution graphics editors like GIMP, photoshop, and even Paint to block out patterns for their grid-based crafts.

Why not? After all, we'll use whatever tools are most readily available to help realize the vision of our crafts.

Looming is meant to provide the same benefits, without the hassles and drawbacks of visualizing your own patterns with less specialized tools. As free, open source software, you are free to download, install, use, and share Looming.

Unlike closed-source proprietary visualizers, you are also free to look under the hood, soup it up, and share those features with the community. 

Not a programmer? No problem! Looming is hosted on Github, which provides powerful tools to hold conversations with the programmers where you can request features, ask for clarification, report bugs, and more!


Core Features
-------------

No more repetitively clicking or erasing to change the color of each stitch, bead, or tile one at a time when you need to move, add, or delete part of your design!

The biggest feature that sets Looming apart from graph paper and spreadsheets is the ability to create, save, and import repetitive aspects of your pattern. Let's call these parts "brushes."

Once you add a brush to your project, you can copy it, change the colors of the copies, and move them around, alone or in groups.
