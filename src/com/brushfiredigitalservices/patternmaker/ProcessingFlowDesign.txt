A Project is based around a rectangular workspace There is always a 2D size to the 
workspace, though data about locations outside of the workspace is retained in some 
conditions. The workspace (and always the whole workspace) is the only region which 
is rendered to the screen. The workspace has a background color which displays in 
all areas in a GUI output not otherwise drawn to by the Project. In this sense, the 
workspace background can be thought of as the "table" the Project is "resting" on.
A BufferedImage holds the image which represents the current state of the workspace
as it should be drawn to a GUI output.
There are zero or more ProjectLayers in a Project. Each ProjectLayer is 2D, movable
relative to the workspace, and resizable independent of the workspace. Offset relative
to the workspace is handled by the ProjectManager, not by the ProjectLayer.
The user interacts with coordinates on the workspace, and the ProjectManager converts
workspace coordinates to pass to the ProjectLayer.







The PatternLayer is 2D, implements Resizable2D.
Project is 1D array of PatternLayers
